#### [Here](https://github.com/anyahsu280/toolbox/blob/master/css/sass/main.scss) is the link to my example, which is an edited version of the CSS we did for the dawg-coffee challenge many weeks ago.
I went a little variable happy on my SCSS page to show how you can use variables, unlike standard CSS. I also
demonstrated nesting, which is a super useful way to write code that is neater and easier to read.

###What it is:
This example demonstrates using SASS, which is a preprocessing tool that makes writing and reading CSS much
easier by using variables, nesting, mixins, etc.

###Why it is useful:
A web developer would want to use this technology when doing front-end developing. SASS would help
them write a lot of CSS without it being as confusing or repetitive. It makes it much more succinct and
easier to read, which in turn makes it easier to edit, find mistakes, and improve. This also makes it easier
for teams to work on code efficiently.

###Limitations:
After some research, it seems that people are pretty happy with SASS and other preprocessors. I've read
that they are all pretty level for almost all of the work that people want to do. Many agree that SASS
is the "more robust, mature language" but ultimately everyone seems to agree that it is just personal
preference for which preprocessor to use.
